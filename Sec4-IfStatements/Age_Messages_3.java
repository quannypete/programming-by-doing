/**
 * Age Messages 3
 * http://programmingbydoing.com/a/age-messages-3.html
 * Using if statements with compound conditions (like &&), make a program that displays a single message depending on
 * the age given.
 * - age less than 16, say "You can't drive."
 * - age between 16 to 17, say "You can drive but not vote."
 * - age between 18 to 24, say "You can vote but not rent a car."
 * - age 25 or older, say "You can do pretty much anything."
 * This output of this assignment is identical to the "How Old Are You, Specifically" assignment. However, this time you
 * must accomplish it using if statements with compound conditions and you must not use else if or else.
 * You can make up your own messages if you want, but you must have at least four messages, and you must use &&
 * statements to make sure only one of the messages is printed for any given age.
