* Basic ArrayLists 1
* https://programmingbydoing.com/a/basic-arraylists-1.html
* Create an ArrayList that can hold Integers.
* Add ten copies of the number -113 to the ArrayList. 
* Then display the contents of the ArrayList on the screen..
* This time, you must use a loop, both to fill up the ArrayList and to display it.
* Also, in the condition of your loop, you should not count up to a literal number. 
* Instead you should use the size() of your ArrayList.
