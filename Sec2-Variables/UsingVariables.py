# Using Variables
# http://programmingbydoing.com/a/using-variables.html
# Write a program that creates three variables: an int, a double, and a String.
# Put the value 113 into the first variable, the value 2.71828 into the second, and the value "Computer Science" into
# the third. It does not matter what you call the variables... this time.
# Then, display the values of these three variables on the screen, one per line.
# You must use three variables. Your program will probably have nine lines of code inside the curly braces of main().

a= 113
float= 2.71828
subject= "Computer Science"
print "This is room # %d" % a
print "e is close to %f" % float
print "I am learning a bit about %s" % subject
