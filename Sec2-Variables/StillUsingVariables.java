/**
* Still Using Variables
* http://programmingbydoing.com/a/still-using-variables.html
* Write a program that stores your name and year of graduation into variables, and displays their values on the screen.
* Make sure that you use two variables, and that the variable that holds your name is the best type for such a
* variable, and that the variable that holds the year is the best type for that variable.
* Also make sure that your variable names are good: the name of a variable should always relate to its contents.
