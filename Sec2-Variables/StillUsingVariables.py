# Still Using Variables
 # http://programmingbydoing.com/a/still-using-variables.html
# Write a program that stores your name and year of graduation into variables, and displays their values on the screen.
 # Make sure that you use two variables, and that the variable that holds your name is the best type for such a
 # variable, and that the variable that holds the year is the best type for that variable.
# Also make sure that your variable names are good: the name of a variable should always relate to its contents.

name = "Quanny Hampton"
grad_year = 2020

print "My name is %s and I'll graduate in %d." % (name, grad_year)
