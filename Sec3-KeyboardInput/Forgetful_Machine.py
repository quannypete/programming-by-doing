# Ask the user for two words and two numbers, and let the person at the keyboard type in some values, but don't bother
# storing their responses into any variables.
# Again, there is no need to create any variables, except for the Scanner variable typically named keyboard.

raw_input("Give me a word\n")
raw_input("Give me another word\n")
raw_input("Great, now your favorite number?\n")
raw_input("And your second-favorite number...\n")
print "Whew! Wasn't that fun"
